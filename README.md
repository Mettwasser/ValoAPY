# ValoAPY
A Valorant API Wrapper made in and for Python

## Features
- Access Player Data
- Access to Skins and their prices
- Access to Match Data and the Match's rounds

## Installing
- Run ``pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ValoAPY==1.2.0``

Note that there might be some bugs, if you spot one, I am more than happy to fix it

# Please Note
This package is nowhere near perfect.
I even had a lot of trouble just uploading the package to testpypi.. so please don't have your expectations too high.
I am still somewhat a beginner when it comes to things like API Wrappers with the big scope on classes.
This is my first bigger project I am willing to improve and put a lot of time and effort into.
